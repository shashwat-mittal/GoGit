**Ques** - How to edit the last commit message in git?

**Ans** - To edit the last commit the user has made, use this command <br />
git commit --amend -m "title" -m "description" . <br />
You can also write the commit message in vi editor using amend command.
However using this command makes a new commit hash, so one need to force push it to be reflected in remote repo.
