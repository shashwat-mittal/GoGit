### Ques-1 How and why merge conflicts arise?

**Ans-1** According to me, merge conflicts arise when two different changes on the same line occurs in a file. Eg. merging 2 branches. However git cannot solve it automatically, thus its the work of the developer to consider which changes he likes to keep.

**Ans** - It is medium through which a local server can send/receive data to a remote server in a secure manner. SSH has a public and private key.

- Data is encrypted (specially username and password is secured)

**Ques** - How to edit the last commit message in git?

**Ans** - To edit the last commit the user has made, use this command <br />
git commit --amend -m "title" -m "description" . <br />
You can also write the commit message in vi editor using amend command.
However using this command makes a new commit hash, so one need to force push it to be reflected in remote repo.

### Ques-2 Is force push a good practice? Yes/No why? In most of the tasks on this repo, you used force push, so why this practice is Okay (neither good nor bad) in your case?

**Ans-2** Force push is not a good practice though as it changes the git commit history. The other contributors working on a project can face issue due to this.
In our case, as working on the individual named files, doesn't make any change to the files of other contributors. Moreover, in our case we as individul were working on our own repositories. The owner of the repo if force pushed the changes then all the other contributors working on the repo may loose some data.

### Ques-3 Name anyone Git or Github topic on which any issue is not made on this repo. (Your answer should be different from others.

**Ans-3** Working on some issue that uses some concept of detached head if added can be really helpful.
