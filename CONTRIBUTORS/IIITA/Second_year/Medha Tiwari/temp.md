Ques - 2 Should I make some issues on GitHub workflows for some Maven and Gradle projects?
Ans. Yes

Ques - 4 If you have made only two commits for this task, then why there are only two, not three, and if there are three commits for this task then why there are three, not two?
ans. There are ony two commits because I have stashed ques-2 and ques-3 in a single stash (using git stash --all -m"msg")
