Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH keys comes in pairs, each pair is made up of : private key and a public key. 

SSH (Secure socket shell) is simply a protocol which is used to securely log onto remote systems.

One way to use SSH is through automatically generating public-private key pairs to simply encrypt a network connection, and then use password authentication to log on.

SSH key allows us to fetch and push data without having to authorize using our gitHub password every time when we push or fetch it.
