Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it? (Issue: 223)

Ans) SSH key is another way to indentify ourself instead of username and password. 
     SSH keys come in pair, containing public key and private key.
     The private key remains with the user and the private key can be shared with services (eg: Github).
     For example, when you are trying to clone a repository from github, the keys are checked, and when
     they match, access is granted.
     Advantages:
        SSH keys are more secure than username and password.
        Easily identify yourself instead of typing username and password.
