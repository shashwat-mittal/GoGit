### What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it? 
As per my understanding SSH keys authenticates a secure connection between remote parties by using two keys - a public key and a private key.While working with GitHub ,we are very often asked to authenticate our account and identify ourself by using the GitHub username and password.So using SSH key dosen't require us to do that every time.The public key encrypts the data while the private key decrypts it.The cryptography of the keys is done in such a way that nobody can decrypt the private key using the public key therefore making it completely secure for the owner.
