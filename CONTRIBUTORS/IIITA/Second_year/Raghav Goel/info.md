What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH key is a method that can be used for authentication different from normal passwords mainly in the way it operates. 
SSH keys are more long than typically used passwords and are computer generated, making them less prone to hacking. 
 They are not stored on servers, but only the device which is being used for login, hence again
making it less vulnerable to hacking.
 
 How to edit the last commit message in git?
 The following commands should be executed:-
 1.git commit --amend -m "New message" 
 2.git push --force repository-name branch-name
 If you are not sure whether someone has cloned your repository after your latest commit, instead of the second command, use
 git push --force-with-lease repository-name branch-name
 This command will abort the push if there are any upstream changes to the repository, whereas the --force command will destroy any changes.


 How to delete a commit?
 I will use git reset --hard HEAD^ to delete the latest commit i will have made.
