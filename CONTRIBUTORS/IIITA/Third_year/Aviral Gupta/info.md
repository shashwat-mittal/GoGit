<b>Ques - 1 How and why merge conflicts arise?</b><br>
When git is unable to resolve the difference between two commits while merging those commits, a merge conflict occurs. <br>
When all the changes in the two commits occur on different lines or in different files, Git will merge the changes without any conflicts. However, when there are changes in the same lines, git can't figure out which code to keep and which to discard and thus asks the user to resolve it.
Amerge conflict can arise in merging a branch, rebasing a branch or cherry picking a commit.

<b>What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?</b>
SSH(Secure Shell) keys are an access credential that us used in the SSH protocol. While working with github, we need to verify ourselves using our username and password. SSH key is an alternative way to verify ourselves.<br>
SSH keys are more difficult to hack than passwords and thus are more secure.

To edit the last commit message one must use ```git commit --amend``` comand.

first commit

second commit:<br>
Steps:<br>
I have removed the first commit.<br>
Step 1: Finding the commit before the first commit using git log<br>
Step 2: Checkout that commit using git checkout<br>
Step 3: Make a new branch using the current checkout commit git checkout -b new_branch<br>
Step 4: Adding the commit after the removed commit git cherry-pick<br>
Step 5: Resolving merge conflicts and pushing our changes.<br>
Step 6: Double checking everything using git status.<br>
Step 7: Finally, switching to the original branch and performing a hard reset to the commit prior to first_commit using git reset --hard<br>
Step 8: Merging new_branch using git merge new_branch<br>
Step 9: Force pushed the changes in the repo using git push --force origin main<br>

<b>Ques - 2 Is force push a good practice? Yes/No why? In most of the tasks on this repo, you used force push, so why this practice is Okay (neither good nor bad) in your case?</b><br>
No, force push isn't a good practice because after force pushing all the changes made by other members will be lost. <br>
Since, I have a local copy of the repo and I am the only one making changes to that repo, force pushing is okay.<br>
